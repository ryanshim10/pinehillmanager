- Ryan asked about building an Android app for managing 19-unit studio rentals.
- Requirements: contract scan OCR extracts phone, contract term, rent, deposit, move-in/out dates, move-out fees; store original contract image; read bank deposit SMS (KakaoBank) to record payments.
- Sharing/sync: keep Google Sheets as continuously synced source for unit status + payment/expense summaries only (no sensitive docs/SMS/phones for sister).
- Payments status should auto-classify (완납/부분납/미납) but user can override.
- Expenses: auto from withdrawals if possible; treat as shared/common expenses.
- Reservation message task: 란향(Uiwang) Feb 6 18:00 for 4 under 심경민; Ryan said it's done.
